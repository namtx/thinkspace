- The best option available in HTTP/1.1 is pipelining. Pipelining means that although requests can share a connection, they must queue up one after the other until the request in front completes. HTTP/2 improved pipelining by using connection multiplexing. Multiplexing allows for multiple requests to be sent on the same connection and at the same time.
