### Problem
As we already know, the Dispatch function from the `useState` hook accept a function as an async dispatcher. So, we can't pass a function into this dispatcher as expected. Example:

```typescript
const [callback, setCallback] = useState<() => void>();
// then
setCallback(() => doSomething()); // ‚ùå  we can't do this, as the returned value of `doSomething` will be pass into the `callback` value.
```

### Solution
We need to pass a function that returns a function that returns a function üòÇ 

```typescript
const [callback, setCallback] = useState<() => void>();
// then
setCallback(() => () => doSomething());  // ‚úÖ correct!
```
